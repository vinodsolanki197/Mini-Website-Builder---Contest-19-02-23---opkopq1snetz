In this app we will be replicating small functionality of a website builder app.

We will give user the option the change the text,background-color and padding of a div
and they will be able to see the changes as they happen.

First create a form, with input elements for taking in text(default value="I change") and a color picker.
Also a slider(range) which will be used for changing the padding(max should be 32), make sure to apply proper semantics 
to each element and give the relevant type attribute on the input elements.

Also make an input which takes number with id="charlimit-input", which dictates the maximum number of characters that can be written in the input,and displayed inside that div.

All of these property changes will reflect in a div with id="changing-div".
The text we type in form should appear inside this div, also this div's backgroundColor will change as we change the color in the form, same for padding.
